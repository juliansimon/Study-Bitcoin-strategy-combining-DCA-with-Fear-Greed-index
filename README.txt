# Study of a BTC strategy combining DCA with the Fear and Greed index

## Analysis of an investment strategy for the purchase of bitcoin where the DCA (Dollar Cost Average) and the market sentiment, Fear and Greed index, are combined.
 
The strategy will consist of the moment that would correspond to the periodic purchase (DCA) the Fear and Greed (F&G) metric will be evaluated
and if it has a value greater than 50, which is equivalent to a positive market sentiment
At the end, a comparison will be made of this combined strategy against a standard DCA during the period that data from the Fear and Greed index are available, Which is from February 2018 to the present.

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a type of strategy that consists of investing the same amount of money every so often
It is independent of what happens in the market since you will invest the same, even if the price of BTC goes up or down.
This reduces the impact that an entry into the market at the wrong time may have and minimizes the consequences of the high volatility of BTC.
Initially it is intended to buy and hold (hodl) but it is not mandatory
It is a practically neglected option. You invest an amount of money at a certain time and leave it there for a while with the idea that bitcoin will tend to rise in the long term
It does not require a large initial investment and allows you to plan your risk.

The Fear and Greed Index is a metric published by https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/ that attempts to predict market sentiment based on these 5 indicators:
Volatility (25%)
Market Volume / Momentum (25%)
Social Networks (15%)
Dominance (10%)
Trends (10%)
