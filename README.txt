In this Python notebook, an analysis of a bitcoin investment is carried out by combining a DCA (Dollar Cost Average) strategy together with the Fear and Greed (F&G) index that is published daily.
A DCA strategy is a recurring purchase of the same amount of money, in our study it is combined with the F&G index and a backtesting will be carried out assuming that 100 dollars are purchased in the weeks where the Fear and Greed index is greater than 50.

This Notebook serves as code support for the post "Study of a BTC strategy combining DCA with the Fear and Greed"
