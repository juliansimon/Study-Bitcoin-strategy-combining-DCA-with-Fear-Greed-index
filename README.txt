In this Python notebook, an analysis of a bitcoin investment is carried out by combining a DCA (Dollar Cost Average) strategy together with the Fear and Greed (F&G) index that is published daily.
A DCA strategy is a recurring purchase of the same amount of money, in our study it is combined with the F&G index and a backtesting will be carried out assuming that 100 dollars are purchased in the weeks where the Fear and Greed index is greater than 50.

=======
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a type of strategy that consists of investing the same amount of money every so often
It is independent of what happens in the market since you will invest the same, even if the price of BTC goes up or down.
This reduces the impact that an entry into the market at the wrong time may have and minimizes the consequences of the high volatility of BTC.
Initially it is intended to buy and hold (hodl) but it is not mandatory
It is a practically neglected option. You invest an amount of money at a certain time and leave it there for a while with the idea that bitcoin will tend to rise in the long term
It does not require a large initial investment and allows you to plan your risk.

The Fear and Greed Index is a metric published by https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/ that attempts to predict market sentiment based on these 5 indicators:
Volatility (25%)
Market Volume / Momentum (25%)
Social Networks (15%)
Dominance (10%)
Trends (10%)
